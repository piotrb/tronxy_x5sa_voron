# TronXY X5SA -> Voron Trident Conversion

Work in Progress

I opted for "topic" based mini readmes, so have a look in each folder and see what's there.

This should be mostly complete, ther's better ways to organize this all I'm sure, but this may get you somewhere closer to a full trident conversion.

## Old Outdated Docs / V1 Conversion / etc

Ther's stuff in the [Archive](Archive) folder which is older .. especially the Old Docs folder there may have a bunch of additional detail that's not in these folders here.
