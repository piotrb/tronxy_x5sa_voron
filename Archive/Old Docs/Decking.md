In the Voron 1.8 mode, I'm opting for a split deck design .. this allows for it to be easily removed from the top, even with the Z motors in place.

Given that the decking shape is quite different between the V1.8 and VT .. the decking will need to be replaced once in VT mode, not an issue with Corrugated Plastic being cheap :)
