Its 6-24v in, the rest I will have to test with experiments .. seems like its switching on ground, so it'll need pull-up .. but otherwise should work .. 
With a 8mm effective range .. it may actually work nicely on a Volcano without having to re-adjust the probe position ..

I ended up trying to make it work, but it seems like cloned omron sensors from Aliexpress do way better here .. I've since moved away from even that and use an Eddy probe.
