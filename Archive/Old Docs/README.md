This is a repo to track work I'm doing on converting a Tronxy x5sa to a Voron Chimera of some sort .. 

# High Level Objectives:

* Try to re-use as many parts as possible
* Try to make this into a gradual upgrade with "usable" milestones along the way.

# Milestones:

## 1. Open Frame V1.8 Style conversion

Goals:
* Mechanically everything works
* Printer *could* be enclosed at this point
* Some aspects could be rough and not quite pretty enough to request a serial
* At this phase, at least for me, I'll put on an Afterburner toolhead.
 * I have a few reasons:
   1. I have one leftover from my Switchwire when I upgraded it.
   2. I have some High Flow CHT heaters I've been itching to use, its easier to get volcano style mods for the AB .. they exist for the SB, but require an alternate whole Front piece .. which means I'd need to have two of those ready to go to be able to alternate between long and short nozzles ... 
   3. It just feels like a more modular design to hack on .. I've also been meaning to play with multi-material printing .. I even have a bunch of 2 in 2 out (and 2 in 1 out) heatsinks and whatnot .. my Switchwire was just annoying to try to build that onto :)
* Extra Credit: I've not seen a mod for this .. I'm going to try to see how I can either use the CW2 with the AB, or mod the CW1 so it mounts as easily as the CW2 (no back screws)

## 2. Enclosed V1.8 Style printer

Goals:
* Extra cost here, I will get Acrylic panels cut at this point
* I do plan to keep using coroplast for the opaque panels, its cheap and then I don't have to worry about the differences between the 1.8 and Trident Decking.
* This would qualify for a V1.8 Voron Serial
* Any final touches to make the electronics bay pretty and nicely cable routed.

## 3. Trident and beyond

* Start thinking about what would be needed to take this towards a trident design.
* I know the bed assembly will be a bit of a problem, so that will need some serious thought
* The rest actually shouldn't be too much of a problem, re-print a bunch of the parts, move the linear rails below the extrusions .. etc .. I'm already trying to hybridize Trident elements in the original design to make this as waste-less as possible.
* I'll likely wait until this phase to install the TAP, I have a kit for it kicking around, so I'm keen to know if the bed is now stable enough for it to be reliable.

In the "Beyond" category .. 

* Trident Idex?
