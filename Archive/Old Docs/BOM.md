## Toolhead

There will be no attempt at recycling the toolhead, there really doesn't seem much worth salvaging there. So the BOM will include basically the regular BOM for an AB or SB toolhead.

** I will try to re-use the TR Black bed sensor .. curious about it :) If that fails .. I do have a few spare Aliexpress voron spec Omron sensors.
