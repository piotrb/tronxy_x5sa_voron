## Frame Extrusions:

Initially the frame is assembled as per the TrronXY instructions (ie the 12 main extrusions)

## Skirt Legs:

Because of the differences between using cleaner joints and just 2020 extrusions .. the M5 mounting hole on the Trident Legs ends up right over top one of the screws. So custom corner pieces have to be used. They're a minimal change to make the screw slot longer, this perhaps doesn't give it as firm of a hold, but it seems good enough.

I opted to just re-use the original rubber feet that came with the Tronxy, just stick a M5 screw through them and they work.

Materials Used:

Item | Qty | Notes
--- | --- | ---
M3x6 BHCS | 12 | for attaching the accent to the legs
M5x16 BHCS | 4 | for the actual rubber feet
M5 Nut | 4 | also for the rubber feet
The Tronxy rubber feet | 4 | you can easily put a M5 screw through them
M5 T-Nut | 4
M3 T-Nut | 4
M5x10 BHCS | 4 | or a couple of washers and a M5x12 .. its for the legs .. probably doesn't need to be that perfect
M3x8 SHCS | 4

## Skirt Panels:

Notes:

* Frame Depth is 10mm less than the 350mm spec .. which means I may have to use the 300mm spec side skirts .. and find a way to patch the gap .. 
* Width is 20mm more than the 350mm spec .. which means I will have to use the 350mm spec front/back center pieces, but stretch them by 20mm

I tried to re-use the original panels as much as possible. The only pieces I had to re-size was the center pieces, so the side pieces are original Trident parts. The side-middle and the front/back middles are slightly resized to cover the frame size differences.

## Electronics

I really like the idea of this mod: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/LoganFraser/TridentInvertedElectronics

I hated having to flip my SwitchWire to access the elctronics .. this will need some tinkering .. 

It also mentions Using v2.4r2 Fan mounts .. I never really gave that a proper look .. it may make sense to consider skirt elements from the 2.4 instead ... 

## Front Display:

TODO. I'm not a huge fan of using the two ribbon mounted LCD's .. the wiring gets annoying and the functionality is so limited :) .. so I ended up just adapting one of the back blank pieces as a blank center piece. This conversion doesn't really do a display .. I may get around to resizing the display mount one day.
