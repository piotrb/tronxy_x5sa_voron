Bed Extrusions:

* 490mm
* 300mm

I may also want to copy the idea https://forum.vorondesign.com/members/dread.6231/ had around instead of modifying parts to fit the 2040's .. this can also be solved by just adding two 490mm extrusions at the front and back bottom at no loss of print volume .. I may do that .. this will add more extrusions to the conversion BOM .. but why not right? it'd be like maybe adding $20 to the BOM .. and allow using more stock parts .. 

so in that case .. 

* 2x 490mm

The extra extrusions should be M5 tapped .. 
The Bed extrusions .. I guess we only need the 300mm one to be tapped on one side
