This folder is a bit of a catch all for a few odd mods I did to make everything work.

I ended up using this particular adapter for the back connector:

And the microswitch mount from here:

https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/main/printer_mods/Minsekt/Rear_Umbilical

This all worked out pretty well ...

I like these two because they together allow not needing a customized version of the AB motor mount system.

I don't have a lot of advice for the toolhead side of the umbilical .. 

I personally use the XOL toohead .. so the mounting is quite different, and I have my own mods here for that :) 

But there is plenty of PG7 cable gland adapters out there.

Just don't make the mistake I did and get the correct sized glands :)
