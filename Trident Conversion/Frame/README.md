Ah frame .. 

You will need to buy some things here .. 

BOM:

Item | qty | Notes
--- | --- | ---
2020 Extrusion 420mm | 2 | (X axis) M5 tap on both ends
2020 Extrusion 360mm | 1 | (back horizontal) no tap
2020 Extrusion 405mm | 1 | (back vertical) M5 tap on one side only (both sides is ok, but only need one)

I had good success with this store: https://www.aliexpress.com/store/911747370 they have preset sized extrusions, but they will cut/tap them on request. They did that quite quickly for me and the packaging was great too, good padding, so there little change of damage in transit.

You can re-use the X extrusion from the Tronxy, but you will have to cut it down to size. It needs to be 450mm long.
