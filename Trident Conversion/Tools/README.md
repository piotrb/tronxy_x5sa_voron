## 105mm Y alignment spacer (print 2 of them)

this is used to align the Y axis when you're fastening the frame together.

Now I don't know if this was the best choice for sizing .. I feels a bit squisky in there .. 

I'm no longer sure why I opted for 105mm .. the Trident standard is actually 110mm .. so I don't necessarily recommend you follow my choice here ..

If I was doing this again I'd just do the voron standard here.


## the 115mm Extrusion Drill Guide

This is used to drill the access holes for attaching the Y axis crossbars

Many notes same as above .. it'd be 120mm per voron spec instead .. 


## Back Center Drill Guides

Print A and B (these should be printable diagonally on a 250mm print bed)

These just give you a nice way to drill the center access hole for the Back Z extrusion mount.
