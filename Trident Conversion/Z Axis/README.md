# Z Axis

## Z Mount Adapter

This piece allows you to use the stock Front Z motor mounts.

The Smaller version is for use with the inverted electronics mod mount variants.
The Regular is for the BOM variant.

You will need two of these, as well as:

* 4x M5x10 Socket Head Cap Screws
* 4x M5 Hex Nuts

## Z Motors .. 

I could have gone for the BOM lead screw motors .. but those tend to be expensive .. 

I did end up buying a set of "nicer" StepperOnline motors 

Also to have a matching set of motors to avoid any weirdness with having mismatched motors .. 

But you can totally do with the stock 2 Z motors, and then just add another ... similar one .. it *should* work, but YMMV :) 

The two Z screws that came with the Tronxy are the right length, you need another one of similar length for a full set for a trident.

I ended up going through a few options around the coupling of the motors and the lead screws .. in the end I ended up with these flexible couplings from Amazon that worked the best.

I would also recommend really carefully setting up your Z screw coupling, I had issues with the screw being a bit offset and rubbing on the leadscrew nut.

Speaking of which, I opted to get the POM leadscrew nuts, this worked out well for me, they seem to work well and are quiet.

Also, you know how the voron guide talks about keeping the leadscrew nut a but lose .. well you need that :) 

I also realized with some trial and error that you want to kind of offset the orientation of the screws that hold the nut .. 

- only 2 screws hold it, this is on purpose, this allows it some wiggle in the direction they're mounted.
- so assuming we use clock hand positions for the locations, you may want to set the back to 12 and 6, and the front (both of the front ones) to 3 and 9 .. this way the back can wiggle a bit forward and back, and the sides can wiggle a bit side to side. This should allow things to settle to a good position.

## Linear Rails

You will need 3x ~380mm linear rails (follow voron spec for the type and all, its just the length that changes)
