My particular choices necessitated a tophat .. (basically opting for umbilical .. which was always what I was going to do .. )

Needing custom sizing, and not really wanting to burn through rolls of ASA in prototyping this I decided for a very light weight tophat option.

I published this as a standalone mod:

If you need a tophat, you can give this a try. You can use the leftover coroplast from the decking/back/etc to use as side fillers.
