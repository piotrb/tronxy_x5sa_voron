This is the VT Center Back skirt piece, split into 3 parts (I didn't want to split it in the middle of the voron logo)

This is easily printable on a 250mm printer.

You may need some supports for the channels that connect the pieces, your milage may vary.

This is one of the oldest parts I made, and I didn't really need to revise it, so let me know if you run into any issues.
