I probably had the post "controversial" choice here on the sides .. 

I'm a fan of the Noctua fans, they're annoying though, because the 60mm fans only come in a 35mm thickness.

This makes most conventional side skirt opions just not work well for them .. 

I was inspired by a few different mods for this .. but in the end ended up making my own particular flavor of it.

I will not be including these in this repo, grab them from the link above.

Also, feel free to use other skirt options, the way I modified things, the stock middle piece will work, I resized the side pieces to fit around the stock middle piece.
