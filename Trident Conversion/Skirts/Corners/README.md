Because the Tronxy frame uses 2040 extusions, the stock corners can't quite mount the same way.

I had to alter them a little bit to fit around that limitation.

Also, I tried to re-use the stock feet that came with the Tronxy, so this design also has these little "plates" that basically make the bottom of the feet the same size as the BOM Vorom feet.

The Accent pieces are un-modified, so grab them from the Trident Repo.

This design basically extends one of the mounting holes sideways, and you're expected to use a M3 T-nut to mount that side of the leg.
