I went through a few iterations here .. 

I never really liked the 12864 based screens, the knob seems like such a terrible way to operate the printer if you can use a touchscreen or a website :) ..

So there is a few variants here for you to choose from.

I don't think I ever resized the 12864 mount, I just kind of used the stock one with a bit of a gap on either side.
