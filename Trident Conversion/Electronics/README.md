This was a personal choice, but I really wanted the Inverted Electronics Bay option, and I also was a big fan of the EMS system.

So There is a few slight mods here for this particular purpose.

I also highly recommend swapping our the stock power supply for a genuine Meanwell PSU.

A Meanwell 350W PSU is thinner, so better airflow, and generally should just be safer :) .. Also, it only runs its Fan when it needs, to, rather than constanly .. 

I otherwise replaces all the other electronics, so you will need to make your own choices here.

You will also need to buy a proper power receptacle, the Tronxy one is odd sized and doesn't fit the "Adamtech" style, it felt a lot easier to just buy that rather than trying to make it fit.


BOM:

Item | qty | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Meanwell 350W PSU | 1 |
Power Recepticle | 1 |


## Chains

I tried to use the stock chains .. they're very crude .. 

I ended up just ordering some better ones from Aliexpress .. so the standard voron chain mounts work nicely.
