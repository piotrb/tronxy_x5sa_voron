This is a special mod I made that fits around the 2040 extrusions the Tronxy uses.

The core pieces are the A/B Upper/Lower pieces.

This is a slightly less sturdy mount, but it doesn't waste any print volume.

I also gave the front idlers a similar treatment, but I did add some additional M3 holes so they can attach from a differnt direction, giving it all a pretty sturdy feel.
