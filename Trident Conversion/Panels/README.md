## Panels:

You will want to get some 3mm acrylic panels

Exact dimensions coming .. 

Acrylic Transparent Panel 472mm x 502mm x 3mm | 1 | Top
Acrylic Transparent Panel 472mm x 544mm x 3mm | 2 | Sides
Acrylic Transparent Panel 472mm x 251mm x 3mm | 2 | Doors

Keep in mind that you likely will need to trim the panels for a final fit, so you will need a food file, or a dremel for this.

## Panel Clips

I wanted an easy way to remove my panels if needed .. I went through a few options here .. 

I ended up settling on these:

I had a bunch of spare M2 screws, so this seemed like a good option.

Ther's a M3 based option here, I didn't try it.

## Hinges:

I tried the clamping 270 degree hinges .. they kept slipping from the door .. so I switched to these:

I also ended up needing to modify the way latches to work nicely .. see subfolders ..

I also use the latches from this, but I modified the "frame" side of the latch for a better fit/spacing. So feel free to use that or my mod, its not really specific to this conversion.
